        <h2>Some informations about the club</h2>
        <p class="kalam">Futbol Club Barcelona , commonly referred to as Barcelona and colloquially known as Bar√ßa , is
            a professional football club based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, that competes in La Liga, the top flight
            of Spanish football.

            Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, Catalan, German, and English footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club
            has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto "M√©s que un club" ("More than a
            club"). Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. It is the third-most
            valuable sports team in the world, worth $5.51 billion, and the world's fourth richest football club in
            terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of ‚Ç¨800.1 million.The official Barcelona anthem is the "Cant del
            Bar√ßa", written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espin√†s.Barcelona traditionally play in dark shades of blue
            and garnet stripes, hence nicknamed Blaugrana.

            Domestically, Barcelona has won a record 77 trophies: 27 La Liga, 31 Copa del Rey, 14 Supercopa de Espa√±a,
            three Copa Eva Duarte, and two Copa de la Liga titles, as well as being the record holder for the latter
            four competitions. In international club football, the club has won 22 European and worldwide titles: five
            UEFA Champions League titles, a record four UEFA Cup Winners' Cups, a joint record five UEFA Super Cups, a
            record three Inter-Cities Fairs Cups, a joint record two Latin Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cups.
            Barcelona was ranked first in the International Federation of Football History & Statistics Club World
            Ranking for 1997, 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2015, and occupies the ninth position on the UEFA club rankings as of
            May 2023.[8][9][10] The club has a long-standing rivalry with Real Madrid, and matches between the two teams
            are referred to as El Cl√°sico.
            Barcelona is one of the most widely supported teams in the world, and the club has one of the largest social
            media following in the world among sports teams. Barcelona players have won a record twelve Ballon d'Or
            awards, with recipients including Johan Cruyff, as well as a record seven FIFA World Player of the Year
            awards, with winners including Rom√°rio, Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Ronaldinho. In 2010, three players who came
            through the club's youth academy (Lionel Messi, Andr√©s Iniesta and Xavi) were chosen as the three best
            players in the world in the FIFA Ballon d'Or awards, an unprecedented feat for players from the same
            football academy Additionally, players representing the club have won a record eight European Golden Shoe
            awards.

            Barcelona is one of three founding members of the Primera Divisi√≥n that have never been relegated from the
            top division since its inception in 1929, along with Athletic Bilbao and Real Madrid. In 2009, Barcelona
            became the first Spanish club to win the continental treble consisting of La Liga, Copa del Rey, and the
            UEFA Champions League, and also became the first Spanish football club to win six out of six competitions in
            a single year, by also winning the Spanish Super Cup, UEFA Super Cup, and FIFA Club World Cup. In 2011, the
            club became European champions again, winning five trophies. This Barcelona team, which won fourteen
            trophies in just four years under Pep Guardiola, is considered by some in the sport to be the greatest team
            of all time. By winning their fifth Champions League trophy in 2015 under Luis Enrique, Barcelona became the
            first European football club in history to achieve the continental treble twice.</p>
